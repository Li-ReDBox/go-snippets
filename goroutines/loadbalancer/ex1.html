Yet, the computing tools that we have aren't good at expressing this world view. We can rectify this by exploring concurrency.</p><p>Go is a concurrent language. It makes it easy to design concurrent systems by providing the ability to:</p><ul><li>execute things concurrently</li><li>communicate between concurrently running processes</li></ul><p>There's a misconception about Go and concurrency: many programmers believe concurrency and parallelism are the same thing. They are not, and this talk will try to answer why.</p><h2 id=concurrency-vs-parallelism>Concurrency vs parallelism</h2><p>Here's the core of the distinction:</p><p><strong>Concurrency is composition of independently executing things</strong> (typically, functions). We often use the word &lsquo;process&rsquo; to refer to such running thing, and we don't mean &lsquo;unix process&rsquo;, but rather a process in the abstract, general sense.</p><p><strong>Parallelism is simultaneous execution of multiple things</strong>. Those things might or might not be related to each other.</p><p>Concurrency is about <strong>dealing</strong> with a lot of things at once. Parallelism is about <strong>doing</strong> a lot of things at once. The ideas are, obviously, related, but one is inherently associated with structure, the other is associated with execution. Concurrency is structuring things in a way that <em>might</em> allow parallelism to actually execute them simultaneously. But parallelism is not the goal of concurrency. <strong>The goal of concurrency is good structure.</strong></p><h3 id=analogy>Analogy</h3><p>The operating system manages multiple devices at the same time (disk, screen, keyboard, etc). They are somewhat independent and completely <em>concurrent</em> concerns. However, they aren't necessarily parallel: if the computer has only one core, several things can't possibly run simultaneously. The model here is concurrent, it is structured as a system of concurrent processes. Its reality could be parallel, depending on circumstances.</p><p>Compare this to performing matrix multiplication on a powerful GPU which contains hundreds or thousands of cores. Both the underlying idea and the reality are <em>parallel</em>, it's all about running operations at the same physical time.</p><p>Concurrency allows to structure the system in such a way that enables possible parallelism, but requires communication. Tony Hoare has written &ldquo;Communicating sequential processes&rdquo; (<a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf>https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf</a>) in 1978, where he describes problems and techniques of dealing with these issues. It is the greatest paper in computer science and we highly recommend every programmer to read it. Programming languages like Erlang and Go are largely based on ideas described in it.</p><h2 id=concurrent-composition>Concurrent composition</h2><p>There's a pile of books we need to burn. We have a gopher whose job is to move books from the pile to the incinerator.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//1.png></figure><p>One gopher is slow, so let's add another gopher. But now we need to synchronize them, since they might bump into each other, or get stuck at either side. One way to solve this is to make them communicate with each other by sending messages (like, &ldquo;I'm at the pile now&rdquo; or &ldquo;I'm on my way to the incinerator&rdquo;).</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//2.png></figure><p>How can we go faster? Double everything! Two piles of books, two incinerators! Consumption and burning can be twice as fast now. That's parallel.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//3.png></figure><p>But try to think about it as the composition of two gopher processes. We start with a single process, and then just introduce another instance of the same process. This is called <strong>concurrent composition</strong>.</p><p>While not immediately obvious, concurrent composition is not automatically parallel! It's possible that only one gopher moves at a time. The design is still concurrent, but not parallel. This is similar to the OS example on a single core processor, where two concurrent things might not run in parallel due to technical limitations.</p><p>However, concurrent composition is automatically <strong>parallelizable</strong>.</p><h3 id=different-design>Different design</h3><p>Let's try another approach. There will be three gophers in total:</p><ol><li>One only loads the cart.</li><li>Another runs the cart to and from the incinerator.</li><li>The third unloads the cart.</li></ol><figure><img src=ex1_files//4.png></figure><p>Each gopher is an independently executing procedure.</p><p>This approach is probably faster, although, not by much. There'll definitely be problems like blocking, unnecessary waiting when the books are being loaded and unloaded, the time when the 2nd gopher runs back and nothing useful is happening, etc. Let's add another gopher!</p><h3 id=finer-grained-concurrency>Finer-grained concurrency</h3><p>Now there's a 4th gopher who returns the empty cart</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//5.png></figure><p>This version of the problem will work better than the previous version, even though we're doing <em>more work</em>. Concurrent composition of better managed pieces can run faster. In the perfect situation, with all settings optimal (number of books, timing, distance), this approach can be 4 times faster than the original version.</p><p>This is important! We improved the performance of this program by adding a concurrent procedure to existing design. We added more things and it got faster! The reason it <em>can</em> run faster is that it <em>can</em> be parallel, and the reason it can be parallel is better concurrent design.</p><p>So, we have four distinct gopher procedures:</p><ol><li>Load books onto cart.</li><li>Move cart to incinerator.</li><li>Unload cart into incinerator.</li><li>Return empty cart.</li></ol><p>Think of them as of independent procedures, running on their own, and we compose them in parallel to construct the solution. We can make it more parallel by, well, parallellizing the whole thing:</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//6.png></figure><p>Note what we're doing here: we have a well composed system which we then parallelize on a different axis to, hopefully, achieve better throughput. We understand the composition and have control over the pieces.</p><p>And what if gophers can't run simultaneously (back into the single core world)? No problem, really. Only one gopher runs at a time, and 7 others are idle. The system runs as fast as a single gopher and the overall speed is the same as the first solution. But the design is concurrent, and it is correct. This means we don't have to worry about parallelism if we do concurrency right. Parallelism is optional.</p><h3 id=yet-another-design>Yet another design</h3><p>Two gophers with a staging dump in the middle.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//7.png></figure><p>Two similar gopher procedures running concurrently. In theory, this could be twice as fast. As before, we can parallelize it and have two piles with two staging dumps.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//8.png></figure><p>Or try a different design still: 4 gopher approach with a single staging dump in the middle.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//9.png></figure><p>And then double that! 16 gophers, very high throughput.</p><figure><img src=ex1_files//10.png></figure><p>Obviously, this is very simplistic and silly. But conceptually this is how you think about problems: don't think about parallel execution, think about breaking down the problem into independent components, and then compose in a concurrent manner.</p><h3 id=summary>Summary</h3><p>There are many ways to break the process down. You can easily come up with a dozen more structures. That is <strong>concurrent design</strong>. Once we have the breakdown, parallelization can fall out and correctness is easy to achieve. The design is intrinsically safe.</p><h2 id=real-world-example>Real world example</h2><p>This gophers example might look silly, but change books to web content, gophers to CPUs, carts to networking and incinerators to a web browser, and you have a web service architecture.</p><p>Let's learn a little bit of Go.</p><h3 id=goroutines>Goroutines</h3><p>If we run a regular function, we must wait until it ends executing. But if you put a keyword <code>go</code> in front of the call, the function starts running independently and you can do other things right away, at least conceptually. Not necessarily, remember: concurrent is not the same as parallel.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#00a000>f</span>(<span style=color:#b44>&#34;Hello&#34;</span>)  <span style=color:#080;font-style:italic>// f runs, we wait

</span></code></pre></div><p>(This is similar to running a background shell process with <code>&</code>).</p><p>It is common to create thousands of goroutines in one Go program. There could be millions! Goroutines aren't free, but they're very cheap.</p><h3 id=channels>Channels</h3><p>Under the hood, goroutines are <em>like</em> threads, but they aren't OS threads. They are much cheaper, so feel free to create them as you need. They are multiplexed onto OS threads dynamically, and if one goroutine does stop and wait (for example, for input/output operation), no other goroutines are blocked because of that.</p><p>To communicate between goroutines we use <strong>channels</strong>. They allow goroutines exchange information and sync.</p><p>Here's an example. We create a <code>timerChan</code> channel of <code>time.Time</code> values (channels are typed). Then we define and run a function <code>func</code> which sleeps for some time <code>deltaT</code> and sends current time to the channel. Then, some time later, we receive a value from the channel. This receiving is blocked until there's a value. In the end, <code>completedAt</code> will store the time when <code>func</code> finished.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go>timerChan <span style=color:#666>:=</span> <span style=color:#a2f>make</span>(<span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>chan</span> time.Time)

</code></pre></div><h3 id=select>Select</h3><p>Goroutines and channels are the fundamental building blocks of concurrent design in Go. The last piece is the <strong>select</strong> statement. It is similar to a simple switch, but the decision is based on ability to communicate instead of equality.</p><p>The following example produces one of three outputs:</p><ol><li>If channel <code>ch1</code> is ready (has a value), first case executes.</li><li>If channel <code>ch2</code> is ready (has a value), second case executes.</li><li>If neither is ready, the default case executes.</li></ol><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>select</span> {

If both ready at the same time, the system picks one randomly.</p><h3 id=closures>Closures</h3><p>Go supports closures, which makes some concurrent calculations easier to express. Closures work as you'd expect. Here's a non-concurrent example:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>func</span> <span style=color:#00a000>Compose</span>(f, g <span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>func</span>(x <span style=color:#0b0;font-weight:700>float</span>) <span style=color:#0b0;font-weight:700>float</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>A worker task has to compute something based on one unit of work. It accepts two arguments: a channel to get work <em>from</em> and a channel to output results <em>to</em>. It then loops over all values of the <code>in</code> channel, does some calculations, sleeps for some time and delivers the result to the <code>out</code> channel.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>func</span> <span style=color:#00a000>worker</span>(in <span style=color:#666>&lt;-</span><span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>chan</span> <span style=color:#666>*</span>Work, out <span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>chan</span><span style=color:#666>&lt;-</span> <span style=color:#666>*</span>Work) {

All we need to do is to create two channels (<code>in</code>, <code>out</code>) of jobs, call however many <code>worker</code> goroutines we need, then run another goroutine (<code>sendLotsOfWork</code>) which generates jobs and, finally run a regular function which receives the results in the order they arrive.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span style=color:#a2f;font-weight:700>func</span> <span style=color:#00a000>Run</span>() {
